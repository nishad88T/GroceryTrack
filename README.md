## Deployment

This project is configured for easy deployment on Vercel. Simply connect your GitHub repository to Vercel, and it will automatically detect the Vite React setup and deploy the site.

## Local Development (Optional)

If you wish to run the site locally for testing or development (not recommended for non-coders for updates), you can use the following commands after cloning the repository and installing dependencies:
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

The site will typically be available at http://localhost:5173.

## Important Note

This marketing website is entirely separate from the main GroceryTrack™ application (which is built on Base44). Links on this site that lead to "Get Started", "Login", or similar, will redirect users to the main Base44 application.
